Instead of iterating over a test until it is solved try to fix a test a few times, then if there is little progress and the issue is still persisting, skip the test and add a comment explaining why it isn't working.

Editing test flow:

- Edit test
- Check for IDE issues
- Run the test file to verify success
- upon no IDE issues and successful edits move on to next task
