The story says that the Remnant captain calmly told her crew, \"We aren't going home until we steal that weapon.\" That alien technology became the basis of the Inhibitor Cannon.",
        "\tAlthough the Remnant appreciated the original weapon, they were disappointed that it was too big to fit on most of their ships. Instead of letting their effort go to waste, they instead opted to put their newfound knowledge to use creating a weapon suitable for their more nimble craft. Thus, the Inhibitor is excellent at controlling engagement distances, keeping targets at range by both pushing them backward with the impact of each shot while also slowing their approach by interfering with their engines."

Without a supply of new tentacles to use, the Remnant have been unable to manufacture more. While durable, they rarely last more than a decade, so even the best cared for of the old Void Rifles degraded into uselessness centuries ago. These highly effective weapons are credited with helping the Remnant safeguard their refuges from ground-based threats during their early years.",
