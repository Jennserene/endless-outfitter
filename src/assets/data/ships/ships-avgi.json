Previously, surveying star systems involved launching thousands of laser-propelled starwisp probes, no larger than a few hundred grams each. The hyperdrive turned this paradigm on its head, allowing the Avgi to build sizable probes designed to quickly map out newly accessible star systems. Over the decades, these gradually shrank as the duty of carrying them between star systems was offloaded onto dedicated exploration vessels, the precursors to the Polari-class Scout. This left the modern Optikon as a highly capable and deployable sensor platform, used in both scientific and combat information roles.",
