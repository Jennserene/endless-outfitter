# check

Search for any problems by running the following scripts:

npm run type-check
npm run test:coverage
npm run lint:fix

If anything needs to be changed as a result of the results of these scripts then do all of this over again until there are no more problems to change.

For every file adjusted ensure you check for best practices in any llm-context in the folder the file is in and it's parents
