Before making any plan or change, review any readme available in the folder or it's parents (not including root) for guidelines on how to work in that folder.
For changes in the nextjs app, check [src/README.md](src/README.md)
For changes in scripts, check [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md)
For changes in tests, check [tests/README.md](tests/README.md)

For every change made in src or scripts, try to cover them in tests, then run those tests to make sure they work, following guidelines in [tests/README.md](tests/README.md)
