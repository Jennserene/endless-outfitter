Before making any plan or change, review any llm-context.md available in the folder or it's parents for guidelines on how to work in that folder.
For changes in the nextjs app, check [src/llm-context.md](src/llm-context.md)
For changes in scripts, check [scripts/llm-context.md](scripts/llm-context.md)
For changes in tests, check [tests/llm-context.md](tests/llm-context.md)

For every change made in src or scripts, try to cover them in tests, then run those tests to make sure they work, following guidelines in [tests/llm-context.md](tests/llm-context.md)
